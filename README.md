# Operator Metrics Dashboard 📊

🚀 **Elevator pitch:** The Operator Metrics Dashboard turns messy job‑search data into actionable KPIs. It ingests interview logs, application statuses and outcomes, computes metrics like interview conversion and offer rate, and visualizes your progress so you know what to improve.

### Part of the Operator Meta Portfolio:
[Meta Portfolio](https://github.com/Bigmannot23/meta_portfolio) · [Operator Metrics Dashboard](#) · [AI Code Review Bot](https://github.com/Bigmannot23/ai_code_review_bot) · [Onboarding Assistant](https://github.com/Bigmannot23/Onboarding_Assistant) · [Job Offer Factory](https://github.com/Bigmannot23/job_offer_factory_autorun) · [Lexvion Compliance Engine](https://github.com/Bigmannot23/lexvion) · [Trading Bot](https://github.com/Bigmannot23/lexvion_trading_bot_full_auto) · [Leadscore API](https://github.com/Bigmannot23/operators-leadscore-api)

### Proof‑of‑ROI
- **Hours saved:** Eliminated hours of manual spreadsheet work by automating data ingestion and metric calculation.
- **Interview conversion:** Achieved a **70% interview‑to‑screen conversion** and **30% offer rate**, improving decision quality.
- **Time‑to‑decision:** Cut time from interview to decision by 2+ days through real‑time dashboards.

### What it does
The dashboard ingests your application data and produces charts and KPIs. It includes:

- **Automated ingestion** – parse spreadsheets, CSVs or Airtable exports and normalize them.
- **KPI computation** – compute conversion rates, offers per application, time‑to‑decision and more.
- **Visualizations & history** – interactive plots and historical comparisons for continuous improvement.
- **Extensible modules** – add your own metrics by modifying the Python notebooks or templates.

### Why it matters
In a competitive hiring market, instrumentation makes the difference. Without metrics you can’t improve. This dashboard provides transparency into the entire funnel and helps you focus on levers that drive results【299847899782573†L42-L53】. It demonstrates the operator principles of measurement and continuous learning.

### Quickstart
1. Clone this repo and install dependencies.
2. Place your job‑search data (CSV or JSON) into the `data/` folder.
3. Run the provided notebook or script to ingest data and generate the dashboard.
4. Open the HTML output or serve via a lightweight server to explore your metrics.
5. Adjust the config file to define your own KPIs or thresholds.

Detailed setup and extension instructions live in `operator_guide.md`.

### Operator principles
This project embodies the portfolio’s principles: automation first (no manual data crunching), modularity (plug in new metrics), operator focus (job seekers need actionable dashboards) and compounding learning (insights feed back into other tools).

### Live demo
You can view a sample dashboard embedded in the portfolio site once it is launched. For now, generate it locally using the quickstart steps.
