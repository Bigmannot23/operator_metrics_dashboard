# How to Record a Demo GIF

1. **Install a screen recorder:** Use a free tool like [Loom](https://www.loom.com) or the [Screenity Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screenity-screen-recorder/aecbffgcmjopcojmccdnllopfhigedcf) to capture your screen.
2. **Run the dashboard locally:** Execute `streamlit run app.py` and wait for the UI to load in your browser.
3. **Start recording:** Begin recording and interact with the dashboard—scroll through the metrics, click on charts, and highlight the ROI block.  Aim for a 10–20 second clip.
4. **Export as GIF:** Once finished, export your recording as a GIF or MP4.  Many tools offer a direct “Save as GIF” option.
5. **Replace the placeholder:** Save the GIF in this `assets/` folder (e.g. `dashboard_demo.gif`) and update the links in your README or portfolio to point to it.

A short demo goes a long way toward helping recruiters and collaborators quickly understand your project.
