# Assets for Operator Metrics Dashboard

This folder contains example screenshots and placeholders for the Operator Metrics Dashboard.  Replace the files here with your own captures when you deploy the dashboard.

- `dashboard_placeholder.png` – a light grey block included as a visual placeholder.  Swap this with a real screenshot of your dashboard.
- `how_to_record.md` – instructions on recording a short GIF demo using free tools (e.g. Loom, Screenity).

Keeping your assets here ensures that your README and portfolio remain self‑contained.
