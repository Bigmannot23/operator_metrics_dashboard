# Operator Metrics Dashboard – Meta Summary

The **Operator Metrics Dashboard** is more than an app—it’s a live artifact
that demonstrates my approach to automation, measurement, and continuous
improvement.

## 🔍 What It Shows

This dashboard ingests job search data from `applications.json`, computes
key metrics (applications, interviews, offers, conversion rates, DMs,
follow‑ups, hours saved), and presents them in a Streamlit interface.  A
daily/weekly update script records snapshots of these metrics in
`metrics_history.json`, enabling delta calculations and trend analysis over
time.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

- **Live Proof of Instrumentation:** It shows that I not only build
  automated pipelines but also instrument and monitor their outputs.  Each
  metric tells a story about how efficient my system is and how it
  improves over time.
- **Compounding Leverage:** By tracking and improving my conversion rates,
  I can focus my automation efforts where they yield the greatest return.
  The "hours saved" metric quantifies the leverage gained from automation.
- **Operator Mindset:** The project includes a GitHub Action that
  autonomously updates the metrics history, illustrating end‑to‑end
  thinking and eliminating manual overhead.  Visitors can clone
  the repo, run the dashboard, and immediately see how a data‑driven
  operator works.

## 📈 How to Use in Your Portfolio

Embed the running dashboard in your personal site or link to it from your
GitHub README.  Mention that the dashboard updates automatically and
encourage viewers to check back to see the compounding improvements.  In
conversations with recruiters or founders, use the dashboard to
demonstrate your systematic approach to job searching and pipeline
optimization.

By including this dashboard in your meta‑tier portfolio, you provide
tangible evidence of your ability to combine automation with analytics—a
powerful signal to anyone seeking a high‑impact operator.
